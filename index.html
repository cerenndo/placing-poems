<p>Placing Poems is an online, interactive map offering a chance to write about new and imagined journeys away from the stifling reality of the pandemic.
  
  <br><br>
  For much of the past year, weâ€™ve been restricted by contours, parameters, real or imagined. Poems have freed up the mental space to wonder unashamedly about journeys we will take, discover, and love. 
  <br><br>
  Placing Poems is an opportunity to write about these journeys and place them on a public, interactive map. From visiting a new bakery to sailing to Gola Island, write about any journey, no matter how grand or small. All contributions will be combined, representing many poetic journeys and creating a poetic cartography of anticipated adventures for everyone to enjoy.
