<h1>Placing Poems.</h1>

  

<p>Placing Poems is an online, interactive map for people to write about new and imagined journeys away from the stifling reality of the pandemic. For much of the past year, we have been restricted by contours, parameters, real or imagined. Placing Poems is your opportunity to write about these journeys and place them on a public, interactive map. From visiting a new bakery to sailing to Gola Island, you can write about any journey, no matter how grand or small. Your contribution will be one of many poetic journeys, creating a poetic cartography of anticipated adventures for everyone to enjoy.
</p>

<h3>THE MAP WILL BE LIVE AND OPEN FOR YOUR SUBMISSIONS ON APRIL 22ND. <br><br>SUBMISSIONS CLOSE ON APRIL 29TH, POETRY DAY IRELAND 2021.  </h3>
