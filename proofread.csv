Of Clyst moors developed dreams

Of pastures brown and forgotten lore

Did nought alone the boy must brave

All the world would throw at him

The endless fight a life through night

Never knowing a love that's right

A wish to find unending desire

That goes forever must he retire?

a serious looking man in overalls 
tapped the wheels with a long hammer,
listening for the thud of broken steel.

The warm air of late summer drifted
through the open carriage windows
and corridors where we stood and smoked,
gazing out at the distant hills.

We passed through villages and red-dust fields 
which were harvested with antique tools,
and saw medieval hayricks raised
with pitchforks behind farmyard walls.

When we stopped at a deserted station
everyone stepped out to walk and stretch;
beside a broken fence a man reached up
to pick wild cherries from a low hanging branch.

Then two young boys climbed into the tree,
twisting and breaking twigs and leaves,
and threw them down to the travellers
who gathered round with open hands.

After a long hour the train moved on 
and I looked back at the ruined tree
and at the empty station platform
covered in blood-red spit and cherry stones.   "

The tide came in,
and you went out,
adrift in stormy seas,
floating with life or death.

Fearing, the next dark wave
could drag you deeper down,
to be washed up,
like driftwood.

Life, once somewhere else,
now, lost at sea,
sinks to the bottom.

A bitter wind blows,
angry and loud
masking nature’s way.

In darkness, there is light
that you must find yourself.

As bated breath,
paves a trusted path
from lonely waterfalls
and faded rainbows.

Know your depth,
stand your ground.
Rise above the wake.

In all the sea’s wild places
there is only calm,
above and below the storm,
at rest.
 
Turning tides,
stir a warm sea breeze
and clear blue skies.

Quite: The mighty roar.
Hear that friendly voice
that guides you home.

If, surrendered to the waves
be lost and gone forever.

But, dance with the tides,
sail the shallows, still.

Catch that friendly hand.

Seek new horizons.
Throw caution to the wind. "

in two plastic bags and the little red suitcase 
your mother gave us.

Do you remember the photograph we took? 
in New York City,

“Freewheelin” Bob Dylan”.

I’ll always remember that feeling.
So, you get to keep the photograph, 
I get to keep the feeling.

Bob Dylan doesn’t even know I am, 
he has better things to do.
But as long as I am, I’ll always love you.

If you think I forgot something, anything, 
don’t hesitate to call.
Or maybe now, 
your people will call my people, 
as people do. 
I might just pick up the phone 
just to talk with you.

I didn’t get to fix the fridge, 
the screwdriver is right beside the eggs. 
Get yourself a handyman, as handy as you can.
If you see Bob, give him my regards, 
but keep some regards for yourself.
Don’t forget, remember.
Remember, don’t forget

It wasn't just a photograph, 
it was all my dreams come true.

I sing songs to the fish, 
no matter how deep they swim, actually, 
the deeper, the better. 
I sing to the grotesque faces of the deep sea fish, 
their teeth talons and their eyes huge. 
Maybe, just maybe, 
if I sing loud enough, they’ll hear me.

I sing songs to the bodies that lie at the bottom. 
Maybe they are remainders of war’s division, or 
maybe they just surrendered to her. 
They couldn’t resist her glitter and her pull;
they’re tugged to the bottom of her mass. 
I sing songs to these people.
I sing songs to those who are forgotten. 

Once, on an island in Scotland, 
I sung with my mother’s friend until we saw the seals, so 
still, I sing to the seals. 
My mother encourages me - she tells me that 
the louder I sing, the more will come, so
I sing until we leave the beach.
I will never stop singing to the sea.

I will never stop singing to you, my lover. 
I will stand among you, feel your water,
salty and fresh,
lap at my ankles and my knees and my thighs.
I will reach down and touch you, let your sediment roll between my fingers.

No matter how far away I am, 
I will never stop singing to the sea."

And the people of Bellagio harvest uninfected corn.
They share it with Varenna,
Rowing a mile or two across the lake,
To set it, warm and healthy,
On a large boulder at the harbour.
Then leave with their payment of coins
In a big jar of vinegar.
Here we are again.
My gin has arrived,
They set it on the large boulder in my garden -
Technology making jars and vinegar obsolete,
For now.
I descend from my turret,
Fetch my gin,
Take some air on the stone balcony
And get my exercise on the way back up.
I sip my gin,
Read my books
And contemplate the wonders of Como.
That is all I need,
For now."
44.95739916,-91.70288086,A good beginning,"It bothers me when people pronounce Justin Vernon’s moniker as Bon I-ver, when it’s actually derived from the French word hiver — meaning winter — he found the phrase in a magazine and simply liked the sound of it.

Never mind that it wasn’t a good winter for him — in fact, it sounded pretty miserable, self-exiled in a snowy cabin in Wisconsin, cut up over a breakup which inspired his platinum-selling For Emma, Forever Ago.

But maybe his was a good winter, in retrospect, financially speaking anyway; there are lots of stories of how bands get ideas for naming things — like themselves or their songs or their albums, often from what someone else said

         — like how Sigur Rós decided on what to call their second studio album when they played an early recording (of what would become the title track) to a friend, he simply said ágætis byrjun, meaning: it’s a good beginning.

54.59731902,-5.932877534,This Place,"In bygone days of yore, I used to love this place
Men of Ulster side by side, led and drawn by God’s Grace
Summertime brought cause for great colourful celebration
As we sought to preserve our faith, and our fledgling nation

Then 69 saw riots, in an effort to besiege
And from there came bomb and bullet pull us to our knees
But we’d reserve the right for our nation to defend
So our children from such attack would not then have to contend

'Neath the shroud of the foggy dew I used love this place
To swing the ash or kick a ball and then shake off the chase
The Ardscoil we would frequent for the Ceili dance
Where most would be more focused on finding some romance

But our cultural expression was sought to be repressed
Yet with those who’d fight our corner we were greatly blessed
Park swings tied up on Sunday’s and the vote denied us all
We stood up and were counted to answer freedom’s call

Shook to the core still, from when the times were wild
Tired & bitter, but resolute that I want better for my child
The good, the bad, the ugly all must be reconciled

I wish that they would disappear, the weary lines upon my face
In this time, and in this place

Bloody Sundays, Bloody Fridays, the week was painted red
We may often sit and wonder what might have been instead
Families torn apart and divisions ran true and deep
A legacy that steals any hope of quiet sleep

A time when everything for everyone was there to lose
Fates to be determined by the job or faith you choose
In our darkest moments we could see no reason or no rhyme
From the nightmare we must wake, there must come a better time

With arms laid down the jail doors opened, a bitter pill for some
But what rankles now will disappear as time whence we are from
The olive branches touch for which there is no disgrace
As all now take some stock and offer up some space

We must cherish those we’ve lost but extinguish the hate alone
For nothing can be carried that’s etched in heavy stone
To reach for the sky we must together shed the load
So future generations get the least that they are owed

We look to the future, from when the times were wild
For we both want what’s better, each for our own child
The good, the bad, the ugly will now be reconciled

A new course now is what we must, all together chase
In this time, and in this place"

Thumbs in or out no matter both hold a steadfast grip

None likely to release the rope, or relent to any slip

Just as a young Setanta drove a sliotar at the hound

Later Cú Chulainn drove the Queen of Connacht’s army to the ground

Modern Ulaid often sees him dying on his feet

But as with every tallest mountain there’s a valley just as deep

All across the city Cú Chulainn has been seen

Not least where he’s stooped proudly facing north over High Green

But a hundred yards away is also his arena

As he has shone a light down over Glenalina

The image will prevail be the sky blue or grey

Just as he once stood down on Boundary Way

At the waking of the day, right from early dawn

The warrior makes his presence, perched over Glenbawn

Also front and centre as a beacon there to rule

He stands flanked and centred, elevated in Rathcoole

The day fades to night leaving only that seen for the moon

As Cú Chulainn rests with comrades on the wall in Lenadoon

While high and low both claim him, none can have him solely for their own

It’s in mutual regard for Cú Chulainn that seeds of peace are sown

And not to doubt where to the raven has now flown

For Cú Chulainn could emerge on the hammer or the bone"

landscape of a face and

Is gratefully consumed
By the waiting heat

Grabbed by long scorching fingers and
spirited into the shimmering air


Dust stirs

Where I realised my mistakes were yet lessons in process, and my life a lingering theme of progress as if me myself is an open book for you all.

Where I learnt that you are your own best friend. That hardships of trusting ones other than yourself are not worth the pain and suffering. 

It’s where I never knew I needed to be. It taught me things I didn’t know I wanted.
It did more than I realised and far more than I deem myself capable of.

Into my veins, watching their tails

Snaking up my wrist.

52.648998,-9.64732,Death a View of the Shannon Estuary,"I will die in West Clare in the summer,
on a day I already remember, 
a day like today, when the sun will shine
on the distant mountains across the Shannon estuary 
after two days of incessant wind-blown rain
will have turned the unmown grass in the back field
into a sodden mesh of iridescent green
with the crows' white droppings not all washed away.

It will be a Tuesday, perhaps, before noon,
and the cows in the neighbour's field
will pause at the electric fence to watch
another relative's car sweep into the yard
past my Newfoundland dog who will jump to greet them,
and the undertaker's young assistant 
will turn to an exhausted wife and say,
""That's a nice view you have of the estuary.""

Soon there will come a day I will never remember
and a few, a very few, will never forget,
but, like a yacht on the Shannon estuary,
that memory will slowly drift away. Meanwhile 
I clear the brambles from between the trees
that I may stand beside the disused hay barn
with a clear view, now, of the estuary in sunlight,
and watch a yacht, in full sail, slowly drift away.

So: when and where and how we come to die
is rarely as we think it ought or might 
turn out to be according to what fears
or hopes or wishes we might have indulged. 
Instead, like that incident in the rose garden

We wended our way to Ballybay and the banks of the Annalee
The sun it shone as we drove along the countryside to see
Old Cavan town where the rain splashed down into the Annalee.
At busy Cootehill where the White horse still provided hospitality
We drank some cool beer, it was comfy there near the waters of Annalee
We felt hungry then and searched for a glen where black flies and gnats wouldn't be
But the bugs did beat us, we thought they would eat us
In that glade by the Annalee
But a while we did stop at the picturesque spot and played at photography
But Pat wouldn't pose , so all's left I suppose is a pic of the bright Annalee.
In a field of hay on a tablecloth gay we spread out a picnic tea
The warm sun caressed us, passersby blessed us (!!!??)
As we dined by the Annalee.
At Butler's Bridge on a pub roofs ridge stood a horse, cart, and ' Mother Machree'
Here the river flowed on but we had to be gone
'Twas goodbye to the broad Annalee.
Then on to Slieve Rissell where all was bustle but we sat and looked round us with glee
Outside in the grounds in short bursts and sounds
A fountain played merrily.
In a comfy chair we dallied there 'til twilight crept over the lea
It was hard to leave the luxurious 'Slieve' to go home to Bangor on Sea
It was near midnight when the end was in sight - Cinderellas home from their spree
No handsome prince - only peppermints
But we're footloose and fancy free.

Allowing my heart to come to rest and purge.
Where city gal meets rural roads,
And fiddles play, with tapping toes ... 
But it is the rental bike that offers sights of stillness, beauty and tranquility,
And though I slip in the rain and mud becomes my new fashion look,
This jewel of an island and its people, soothe my soul.
For there, standing on a white beach,
Just behind the drifting clouds,
I see sunshine - a majestic light of hope,
Beckoning me to see; to believe, 
That despite the cross of widowhood, 
I will be OK,
That in time, all will be well.
Doesn't that sound swell ... 
But how I can tell and be sure of that?
Faith. 
Trust. 
I must.
My brokeness now becomes my signpost,
Don't go left, go right.

To grieve, to heal and when the time is right,
to live again.

If I try and see the world 
from the innocence of her eyes,
I can easily forget the worries of my mind and
the relentless aching of my existential bones.
I can peek into the abyss of her curiosity
and marvel at the most ordinary things:
the laundry swishing in the wind;
seeing through sunglasses for the very first time;
rolling down a meadowy slope while in a screaming fit;
hunting for woodlice under countless flower pots,
to see how fast they run once they’ve been unmasked.
Now that she’s here with us, 
time has forever changed its meaning.
It stands still in a vacuum for what seems like an eternity,
then in an instant rushes off at the speed of light.
What makes us feel alive? 
What makes it worth the journey?

I do hope at some point in time 
some one will care to stop and listen to the roaring of our hearts,
